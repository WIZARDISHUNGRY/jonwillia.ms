Jon Williams is a Brooklyn-based artist with a background in formal computer science, film studies &amp; Afro-Cuban percussion. His live video work explores digital-optical feedback technique, samples culled from marathon film screening sessions, and the forgotten alleys of computer graphics. While utilizing both video cameras and analog video synthesis, most images are generated via real-time editing in a software patch environment. In November 2008, he orchestrated the video for Excepter's 17-hour election day telethon at Monkeytown in Brooklyn. He frequently performs music in ad-hoc / semi-improvised groups, including "gauze" art-rockers Enoch A.L.N.; in April 2011, he performed a 37 minute piece on synthesizer in a 13 person, one parakeet ensemble.
