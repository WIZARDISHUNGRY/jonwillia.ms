## What is Go?
--
background-image: nil
> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

â€“ [golang.org](https://www.golang.org/)

--
* Developed at Google and publicly released in 2009.
--

* Characteristics
  * Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C++)

--
  * Readability and usability (like Python or JavaScript)

--
  * High-performance networking and multiprocessing

## Unit testing in Go

```go
package main

func Sum(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    Sum(5, 5)
}
```
```go
package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
    total := Sum(5, 5)
    if total != 10 {
       t.Errorf("Sum was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", total, 10)
    }
}
```

---
## What do we use Go for?
--

#### StockTwits:
* _Rooms_ - persistent process serving web requests from clients

--

#### Brokerage:
* _Sibyl_ - persistent process for ingesting realtime price data for thousands of symbols. Pushes updates to clients over AWS MQTT service â€“ i.e. streaming quotes.

--

* _Perseus_

--
  * AWS Lambda functions, managed with Serverless framework

--
  * Handles client requests via HTTP

--
        * Registration, password change, etc.
        * Linking bank accounts (via Plaid)
        * Trading (via Apex & Neovest)
--
  * Receives trade events asynchronously
---
## AWS Lambda
- Removes the need to maintain infrastructure such as containers and persistent processes.
- We use the Serverlesss(.com) framework.
- Write Go programs to handle events (web requests, mostly) and use a YAML configuration to map events to handlers.

--
```yaml
    login:
        handler: bin/login
        events:
            - http:
                path: /login
                method: post
                cors: true
```

---
## Testing setting user preferences via HTTP
```go
url := fmt.Sprintf("/user/%d/prefs", user.ID)

body, _ := json.Marshal(
    map[string]interface{}{
        "notifications": map[string]interface{}{
            "crypto":   true,
        },
    },
)

req := httptest.NewRequest("PATCH",url,bytes.NewBuffer(body))
test.ForgeBearer(t, user, req)
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

w := httptest.NewRecorder()
router.ServeHTTP(w, req)

if w.Code != http.StatusOK { // check the return code
    t.Errorf("Expected 200 OK. Got %d", w.Code)
    t.Fail()
}
```
---
## Integration testing simple things
* The previous example of setting user preferences is a very simple test case.
  1. We do not have any dependencies on external services.
  2. We merely check that we can successfully perform an action as a logged-in user.

--
* The tooling for these kind of test scenarios is to use a docker container with our test Postgres (SQL) database as the backing store.

--
* This is actually quite fast. Our entire suite (~250 cases) runs in ~45 seconds.

--
* We exploit package level parallelism and test case level parallelism to improve speed.

--
* Each package gets its own database instance; provisioning the database takes about 4 seconds.
---
## Integration testing simple things
* Using a real database engine in our tests allows us to validate that our database queries work as expected.

--
* We can also query our database during a test case to perform additional validation.

--
* When developing software rapidly, test scenarios like this allow some validation of the functionality of *all* of the software components necessary for a feature to work.

--
* Testing all the components utilized in a feature together may not cover all posible scenarios.
--
 More about this later!

---
## When do we write tests?
---
## When do we write tests (ideally)?

--
1. *Before* writing a new feature

--
  * This is a little unrealistic, but thinking about this before beginning work is very helpful.

--
2. Before fixing a bug

--
  * The test case should fail until the bug is correctly fixed.
---
## What is tricky to test?

--
* Scenarios with external service dependencies

--
  * Linking bank accounts
  * Trading

--
* Many external services provide Sandbox or UAT endpoints that may be suitable for use in automated testing.

--
  * Plaid offer us a sandbox environment where dummy accounts may exhibit certain behavior, such as a known account balance.
--

* This allows us to write test around all kinds of account funding scenarios.
--

* A (minor) downside of this is that it require network connectivity to function correctly.

--
* Unfortunately, not all services are this convenient to utilize.

--
  * Apex limits the number of accounts we may create in their UAT environment.
  * Neovest allow only a single instance of their client library to be running at a time in UAT.
---
## What is trickier to test?
* Infrastructure errors

--
  * Some portion of our system may experience an outage during a critical operation.

--
  * Our database connection may die after submitting a trade to Apex or Neovest so we could hypothetically lose a trade.
--
 Don't worry â€“ we handle this correctly! ðŸ˜Ž
---
## Dependency Injection

--
Let's set aside a lot of the hot air around these concept and focus on code.

--
```go
type brokerageEnvironment struct {
	db             *sqlx.DB
	apexService    apex.Service
	plaidClient    *plaid.Client // TODO is concurrent access ok?
	ledgerDao      ledgerDaoIntf
    bpService      buyingPowerService
	sibylService   sibyl.Service
	valueService   value.Service
}
```
Our (usually) code operates on `interface` types that are targets for mocking. What's an `interface`? What's an mock? 
---
## Interfaces
1. An interface is a type whose instances may be assigned any value that satisfies its definition.

--

2. or "Interfaces are named collections of method signatures."
---
## Interfaces
```go
import "math"

type geometry interface {
    area() float64
    perim() float64
}

type rect struct { width, height float64 }
func (r rect) area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}
func (r rect) perim() float64 {
    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height
}

type circle struct { radius float64 }
func (c circle) area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}
func (c circle) perim() float64 {
    return 2 * math.Pi * c.radius
}

```

## What is a mock?
---
## Mocks (in our parlance)
* A _mock_ is an implementation of an `interface` that is only used in tests.
* We use a mock when:

--
  * the object supplies non-deterministic results (e.g. the current time or the current temperature);
  * it has states that are difficult to create or reproduce (e.g. a network error);
  * it is slow (e.g. a complete database, which would have to be initialized before the test);
  * it does not yet exist or may change behavior;
  * it would have to include information and methods exclusively for testing purposes (and not for its actual task).

## Mocking SQS failures

* AWS SQS is Amazon's managed queue service.

--
* We utilize it for queueing trades for our Neovest client written in Java.

--
* How do we simulate an infrastructure failure?
---
## Mocking SQS failures
```go
var tradeQueue *queue.Queue

// Queue is a convenience wrapper for SQS queues.
type Queue struct {
    sqsiface.SQSAPI
}

// SendMessageErrors mock for SQS queues.
type SendMessageErrors struct {
       callCount int
}

// SendMessage emits error.
func (mock *SendMessageErrors) SendMessage(*sqs.SendMessageInput)
     (*sqs.SendMessageOutput, error) {
       mock.callCount++
       return nil, errors.New("MOCK RAISING ERROR ON DEMAND")
}
```
---
## Mocking SQS failures
```go
func TestPostOrderSQSFailure(t *testing.T) {
    tradeQueue.SQSAPI = &SendMessageErrors{}

    orderReq := &ClientOrderRequest{
        Order: brokerage.Order{
            Side:          "BUY",
            OrderType:     "MARKET",
            Symbol:        "MSFT",
            TimeInForce:   "DAY",
            OrderQuantity: 10,
        },
        OrderKey: "uniqueTestTrade",
    }

    rsp := makeOrderRequest(t, router, user, orderReq)
    if rsp.StatusCode != http.StatusInternalServerError {
        t.Errorf("Expected %v status. Got: %v",
          http.StatusInternalServerError, rsp.StatusCode)
    }
    require.Equal(t, mockSQS.CallCount, 1)
}
```
