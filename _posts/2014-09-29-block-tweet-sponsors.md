I find the promoted tweets on Twitter super annoying, so I cobbled together a PHP (sorry!) script to block [tweet sponsors](https://github.com/WIZARDISHUNGRY/block-tweet-sponsors). If anyone has an idea on how to get the mobile timeline so I never see ads for mobile games with in-purchasing, hit me up.
