<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/twitter">@twitter</a> Stop putting things in my feed from people I don&#39;t follow. Hurts the signal-to-noise ratio and decreases utility of the platform.</p>

I find the promoted tweets on Twitter super annoying, so I threw together a PHP (sorry!) script to block [tweet sponsors](https://github.com/WIZARDISHUNGRY/block-tweet-sponsors). If anyone has an idea on how to get the mobile timeline so I never see ads for mobile games with in-purchasing, hit me up.
