  I've been spending time working on music stuff, and decided to share my Ableton Drum Rack for the MFB-522 drum machine.

The MFB-522 Drumcomputer is a discontinued drum machine from [MFB](http://mfberlin.de/) that sounds very similar to the Roland TR-808.
While you can sequence it internally, I prefer to use Ableton Live or an Arturia Beatstep Pro to control it.
To program drum sequences when I only have my laptop, I like to use a sample-based Ableton drum rack such as *Kit-Core 808*.
You should be able to drop this Ableton rack onto your Core Drum sequence to sequence your MFB-522.

The MFB-522's MIDI implementation uses a layout similar to the [General MIDI percussion mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI#Percussion) but deviating on number of notes.
Furthermore, the MIDI implementation chart inside the [MFB-522 manual (PDF)](http://mfberlin.de/wp-content/uploads/mfb-522_english.pdf)
 has several errors in which notes/note numbers correspond to a particular drum sound; keep this in mind when referring to it.
Ableton's core drum racks seem to follow General MIDI Percussion, with their main kick drum located at **C1**.
I've omitted the 808 *maracas* (doesn't have an equivalent in the MFB-522) and *congas* (triggered by the *toms* when a two-position switch is flipped).
The *short clap* and *short bass drum* have been mapped an octave below the regular *clap* and *bass drum*.
