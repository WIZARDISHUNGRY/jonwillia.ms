I’ve [been working]({% post_url 2017-12-15-vcvrack %}) on software modular synth design and finally have a fully featured module ready to share with early adopters.

<blockquote>
<p>
The <a href="https://bongo.zone/">Pulsum Quadratum</a> Rhombic Shift Register (RSR) is a four-voice, demuxing shift
register for the <a href="http://www.vcvrack.com/">VCVRack</a> modular synthesis environment.
The RSR consists of four looping “analog” shift registers whose inputs and outputs are
switched via control voltage.
By skillfully applying modulation, automatic variations upon
source patterns may be generated. Using the Rhombic Shift Register with a sequenced melody allows you to
design complex arabesque patterns and arpeggiations.
On the other hand, you need not need not use a sequencer or keyboard
to play the RSR. Good results have been obtained with quantized stepped and random voltages,
feedback patches and other unconventional sources.

This has been [superceded by a commercial version]({% post_url 2018-03-23-rhombic-shift-register %}).
