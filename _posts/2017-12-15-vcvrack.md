I've been excited by all the activity around [VCVRack])(https://vcvrack.com), an open source software [modular synthesizer]() for desktop computers.
I decided to try my hand at writing a simple [shift register](https://sites.google.com/site/westcoastsynthesis/asr) module for it.
The audio core of a module is just C++ function that gets called once per output sample.
Coding wasn't that hard; perhaps I'll expand on this module.

*The panel SVG labels do not match function!* From top to bottom, the components are:

* Trigger in + trigger led
* CV in
* 4x Shift out + CV led (would be nice to have this indicate scale degree with an RGB value)
