~~<mark>The source code for this is missing right now because I'm working on commercial VCVRack development.</mark>~~

I've been excited by all the activity around [VCVRack](https://vcvrack.com), an open source software [modular synthesizer]() for desktop computers.
I decided to try my hand at writing a simple [shift register](https://sites.google.com/site/westcoastsynthesis/asr) module for it.
The guts of a module is a C++ function that gets called once per output sample.
Implementation was dead-simple; perhaps I'll expand on this module.

**The panel SVG labels do not match function!** From top to bottom, the components are:

* Trigger in + trigger led
* CV in
* 4x Shift out + CV led (would be nice to have this indicate scale degree with an RGB value)
